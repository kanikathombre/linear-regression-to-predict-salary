This project demonstrates how to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience using a linear regression model. The dataset used for this project is salary_data.csv, which contains two columns: years of experience and corresponding salary values. We will implement a linear regression algorithm to build a predictive model and evaluate its performance.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to apply linear regression techniques to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning technique that finds the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

In this case:

Dependent Variable (y): Salary of the employee
Independent Variable (x): Years of experience
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is salary_data.csv. The dataset contains the following columns:

Years of Experience: The number of years the employee has worked in the relevant field.
Salary: The salary of the employee.
Here is a sample of the dataset:

Years of Experience	Salary
1	45000
2	50000
3	55000
...	...
Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and check for missing values.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Apply linear regression on the dataset to train the model.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
